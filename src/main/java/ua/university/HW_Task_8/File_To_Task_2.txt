Find the three longest words in the input file and print them out in the format: word ==> the quantity of the letters 
in the word. The list should be sorted in descending order of the letter's quantity in the word.
If two words have the same quantity of the letters, then the word that occurred in the source file earlier should 
also be earlier in the resulting list.
