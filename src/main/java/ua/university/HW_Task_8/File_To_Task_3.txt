In the input file, find the three words that occur most often (if the frequencies coincide, choose that that occurs earlier), 
and print them sorted alphabetically in reverse order, in the format: word ==> frequency

Find the three longest words in the input file and print them out in the format: word ==> the quantity of the letters in the word. 
The list should be sorted in descending order of the letters quantity in the word.  

If two words have the same quantity of the letters, then the word that occurred in the source file earlier should also be earlier 
in the resulting list. 

In the input file, find the first three words that have duplicates, and print their inversion in upper case.
