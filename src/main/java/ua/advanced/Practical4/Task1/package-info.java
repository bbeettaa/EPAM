Create a child thread that, during about 2 seconds, would print out its name every 1/3 seconds.
Implement it in two ways:
	* using extension of the Thread class;
	* using implementation of the Runnable interface.

First, one implementation should be executed, then, after it has been finished, the other implementation should be executed.
